# NMPC-EVs
In this task, an nonlinear model predicitve control (NMPC) is employed to optimize position tracking control problem of an electric vehicle. A cost function is used to evaluate the performance of the controller and the task is to achieve minimum cost of reference tracking error and minimum battery consumption while satisfying nonlinear operationla constraints of the vehicle. 

In this task, US06 is used as the references.
